# GOES-CORE — GOES Satellite Dataset Access Core Functionality

**NOTE: This project was merged into the [GOES-DL][25] project.**

*Since 1975, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) have
provided continuous imagery and data on atmospheric conditions and solar
activity (space weather). They have even aided in the search and rescue of
people in distress. GOES data products have led to more accurate and timely
weather forecasts and a better understanding of long-term climate conditions.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) builds and launches
the GOES, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
operates them &#91;[1](#hist)&#93;.*

**GOES-CORE** is an open-source Python package that provides the foundations
for streamlining the process of downloading and reading satellite dataset
imagery. This toolkit enables efficient dataset downloading from various
data sources and provides tools for extracting data segments directly from
NetCDF4 files produced by [GOES-R Series][0] satellites &#91;[2](#goesr)&#93;
and other similar datasets &#91;[3](#b1),[4](#ggc)&#93;.

## Key Features

- Seamless integration of different data sources into a unified download
  process.
- High-level API that abstracts away the complexity of data access from NOAA
  archives.

## Project Description

Core repository providing fundamental functionalities for meteorological and
climate dataset handling. This repository consolidates essential code to serve
as a foundation for environmental data processing ecosystems.

## Components

- **Ready-to-use classes**: Includes data source (`DatasourceAWS`,
  `DatasourceNCEI`, `DatasourceLocal`) and `Downloader` classes for direct use
  by end-users.
- **Developer API**: Defines the `Datasource` and `ProductLocator` abstract
  classes for data source handlers and product locators, establishing a clear
  API for developers creating meteorological and climate dataset downloaders.
- **Ecosystem Base**: Serves as a foundation for building and expanding tools
  within the meteorological and climate data ecosystem, promoting modularity
  and code reusability.

## Supported Data Sources

1. **NOAA’s AWS Cloud Archive**: A handler for NOAA’s ([National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration][10]) Amazon Web Services Cloud Archive is
   provided.  *[GOES-R Series][0] (GOES-16 to GOES-18)* real-time data
   &#91;[2](#goesr)&#93; and *[GridSat-B1 Climate Data Record][42]* datasets
   &#91;[3](#b1)&#93; are accessible via the NOAA’s archive hosted on AWS.
2. **NOAA’s NCEI Archive**: A handler for NCEI’s ([National Centers for
   Environmental Information][11]) HTTP repository is provided. Several
   datasets, like *[GridSat-B1 Climate Data Record][42]* and
   *[GridSat-GOES/CONUS][43]* &#91;[4](#ggc)&#93; are available through NCEI
   Direct Download HTTP servers.

## Installation

To install **GOES-CORE**, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install goes-core
```

To update **GOES-CORE**, use:

```bash
pip install --upgrade goes-core
```

> **NOTE**: GOES-CORE is not a stand-alone package, but rather a foundation
> library intended to be used both by end-users directly (through a client
> application or library) and as a framework for developers building tools
> within meteorological and climate dataset ecosystems.

## Usage

See the [GOES-DL][25] satellite imagery data processing package and similar
projects for real world examples.

## Origin and Relationship to GOES-DL and GOES-DR

**GOES-CORE** was created by excerpting core functionalities from the earlier
projects [GOES-DL][25] (GOES Dataset Downloader) and [GOES-DR] (GOES Dataset
Reader).  These projects were restructured to consolidate shared code into
**GOES-CORE**, which now serves as a foundational library.

Specifically:

- **GOES-DL** now depends on **GOES-CORE** to provide the fundamental dataset
  downloading and data handling functionalities that were originally part of
  **GOES-DL**.
- **GOES-DR** has been archived. The remaining functionalities of **GOES-DR**,
  after the core code extraction, have been merged into **GOES-DL**.

This restructuring allows for a more modular and maintainable codebase, with
**GOES-CORE** providing the essential building blocks for various GOES and
other meteorological and climate data processing tools.
